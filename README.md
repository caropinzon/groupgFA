Group G Financial Analytics MBD 2016


##Welcome to Group G's Financial Analytics Innovation and beyond in Big Data System for Model Development System.

We have built 5 distinct algorithms to harness and wrangle two different datasets (dev.csv or MBD_FA2.csv). There is a selection of both human-assisted step-by-step guides to give you control when running the algorithms, and other purely automatic algorithms.

For each of the different *algorithms* you only have to call them with a dataframe as the input. For example, you can perform the Automated Data Cleaning algorithm by typing  groupgFA.autoClean(df) with a dataframe that you select.
